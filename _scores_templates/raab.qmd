  cv: The son of a farmer became a bass player in the Benedictine monastery of Seitenstetten around 1780 and received his further training there from P. Gregor Hauer. From 1788 until his death, Raab was the successor to the monastery organist Christian Widmann. In 1794 he received composition lessons from J. G. Albrechtsberger in Vienna. Raab's sacral works closely follow his role model Michael Haydn.
