  cv: Florian Leopold Gassmann was an Austrian composer and conductor of the Classical era. Born in the town of Brüx (now Most, Czech Republic), Gassmann made a significant mark in the world of opera and instrumental music during his relatively short life. Gassmann was a versatile composer, known for his operatic works. His most notable achievement was his role in the development of opera buffa, the Italian comic opera. He collaborated with librettist Carlo Goldoni on several comic operas, such as *L'opera seria* and *Il filosofo innamorato*. Aside from opera, Gassmann also composed symphonies, chamber music, keyboard pieces, as well as sacral music. His compositions displayed a transition from the Baroque style to the emerging Classical style, marked by clear structures and balanced melodies. Though his life was cut short at the age of 44, Gassmann's contributions to opera and instrumental music left a lasting impact on the musical landscape of the 18th century.
