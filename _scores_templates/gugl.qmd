  cv:
    By 1705 at the latest, Gugl was a member of the court musicians in Salzburg. He was probably a student of Johann Baptist Samber, whose successor as cathedral organist in Salzburg he became in 1717. Gugle belonged to the “Salzburger Theoretikerkreis” which consisted of court and cathedral musicians.
