  cv: František Ludvík Poppe studied theology and law at the University of Prague. He joined the Order of the Red Star Crusaders and took his vows on 11 November 1700. He worked at a number of places in Bohemia, including the church of St. Francis of Assisi in the Old Town of Prague. Poppe's work is based on Venetian polyphony and polychorality. However, homophony is starting to be more prominently enforced.
