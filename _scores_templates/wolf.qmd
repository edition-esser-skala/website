  cv: Ernst Wilhelm Wolf attended schools in Eisenach and Gotha, where he was a student of Gottfried Heinrich Stölzel and got to know the music of Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach and Carl Heinrich Graun, which had a strong influence on him. Above all, he valued the works of Bach, with whom he had a lifelong friendship. In 1755 he went to study at the University of Jena, where he took over the leadership of the Collegium musicum and was able to perform his own compositions. He reached Weimar via Leipzig and Naumburg, where Duchess Anna Amalie hired him as a piano teacher. In 1761 he was appointed concertmaster of the ducal orchestra, in 1763 organist, and in 1772 court music director.
