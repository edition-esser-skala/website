  cv: P. Edmund Sengmillner OSB made his profession in Michaelbeuern in 1678 and was ordained a priest in 1685. From 1686 to 1708 he was an economist and from 1708 to 1714 he was prior of the monastery. His estate included around 650 pieces of music (including his own compositions) that were listed in an inventory in 1714 but have since been lost and which documented the musical life of the monastery in his time.
