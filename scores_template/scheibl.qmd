  cv: Johann Adam Scheibl received his first music lessons from his father, and in 1734 he became organist in the Benedictine monastery in Seitenstetten. Around 1737 he came to the Augustinian Canons' Monastery of St. Pölten in the same capacity, where he was probably promoted to Regens chori in 1751; he held the office until his death. Scheibl also served as choir regent at the Piarist Church for some time. He is considered one of the most important Austrian composers of his time.
