    imslp: Heidenreich,_Joseph
  cv: Joseph Heidenreich is first recorded as a musician in Vienna in 1771. Until 1783 he was organist at the St. Katharina chapel at the Minoritenkirche, and perhaps also until 1783 violinist at the house chapel in the K. k. Court Chancellery. In the 1780s and 1790s, Heidenreich made a name for himself in Vienna as an arranger of well-known operas or parts of them. He gave music lessons from 1800 at the latest.
