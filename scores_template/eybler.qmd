    Joseph Leopold Eybler was an Austrian composer and conductor of the Classical era, known for his contributions to sacred music and his close friendship with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Born in Schwechat, Austria, Eybler displayed early musical talent and received training in composition and counterpoint. Eybler's career was marked by his dedication to sacred music. He held various positions as a composer and conductor in Vienna, including serving as Kapellmeister at the Kärntnertor Theater and the St. Michael's Church. His religious compositions, including masses, graduals, a requiem, and two oratorios, were highly regarded during his time for their craftsmanship and expressive depth. Eybler's efforts preserved this iconic work for posterity. While he may not have achieved the same level of recognition as some of his contemporaries, Eybler's music continues to be appreciated for its elegance and emotional depth. His compositions exemplify the transition from the Classical to Romantic style in Austrian music, leaving a lasting legacy in the realm of sacred choral music.
