  cv: Brixi received his musical training with the Piarists in Kosmonosy and then worked as an organist in various churches in Prague, and from 1759 as kapellmeister in Prague's St. Vitus Cathedral. In his works he continued the artistic contrapuntal and fugue techniques of Johann Joseph Fux, but combined these with elements of the early classical period.
