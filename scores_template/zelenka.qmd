  cv: Jan Dismas Zelenka was a prominent Czech composer and musician known for his remarkable contributions to the Baroque era. His early musical talent led him to study in Prague and Vienna, where he mastered the violin, keyboard, and composition. He eventually joined the renowned Dresden court orchestra, where he served as a double bass player and composer. Zelenka's innovative compositions, characterized by their inventive harmonic progressions and intricate contrapuntal writing, earned him recognition among his contemporaries, including Johann Sebastian Bach. Despite his brilliance, Zelenka struggled to achieve wide acclaim during his lifetime, with many of his works remaining unpublished. However, modern scholarship has recognized his genius, hailing him as one of the most significant composers of his time, particularly in the realm of sacred music.
