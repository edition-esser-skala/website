# Website

## Folders

(Not all of these folders appear in the git repository.)

- `data_generated`: output files generated by the scripts in this repository; can be safely deleted
- `_extensions`: Quarto extensions
- `images`: images used on the website
- `news`: blog posts, with general settings in `_metadata.yml`
- `renv`: R environment data
- `scores`: composer pages (automatically generated)
- `scores_template`:
  - page templates for each composer
  - typically contains a single key `composer_data` in the YAML front matter
    - see `_template.qmd` or available composer metadata
- `script`: bash, Python, and R scripts
- `_site`: Quarto output (automatically generated)

The root folder contains the usual files required by Quarto. Notably,

- `.htaccess` redirects ARKs appended to the base URL to the ARK resolver at `ark.esser-skala.at`
- `apa-6th-edition.csl` describes the citation style
- `_brand.yml` applies brand guidelines ([details](https://posit-dev.github.io/brand-yml/))
- `references.bib` contains BibTeX entries for references
- `styling.scss` customizes CSS


## How to create the webpage

### Manually

1. Create composer pages: `python script/generate_pages.py`.
2. Render with Quarto: `quarto render`.
6. Deploy the folder `_site` via rsync to the folder `edition`.
