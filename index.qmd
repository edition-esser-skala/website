Currently, our focus lies on the following composers:

Johann Michael Haydn
: Our [editions](scores/haydn.qmd) include litanies, vespers, and cantatas. Moreover, the Proprium Missæ project represents a comprehensive collection of short liturgical works (graduals, offertories, hymns, …).

Joseph Leopold Eybler
: We are working on a [complete edition](scores/eybler.qmd) of Eybler's sacral music, including his masses and short liturgical works.

František Ignác Antonín Tůma
: We are working on a [collected edition](scores/tuma.qmd) of Tůma’s compositions, as well as on a [catalogue](https://frantisek-tuma.at) of his works.

Gregor Joseph Werner
: We offer editions of Werner’s [sacred music](scores/werner.qmd). Concurrently, we are working on a [catalogue](https://gregor-joseph-werner.at) of his works.

But don't miss out our other editions, which include several highlights, such as

- the *Missa Providentiæ* by Antonio [Caldara](scores/caldara.qmd), which includes a *Credo* by Jan Dismas Zelenka (ZWV 31)
- a reissue of the *Wohlgeübter Organist* by Johann Anton [Kobrich](scores/kobrich.qmd), a collection of preludes, fugues, and toccatas that was first printed in the 1760s
- a bilingual (Danish/German) edition of Friedrich Ludwig Æmilius [Kunzen](scores/kunzen.qmd)'s *Skabningens Halleluja* (*Das Halleluja der Schöpfung*)
- two passions (*Der gute Hirte* and *Jesu, deine Passion*) by Gottfried Heinrich [Stölzel](scores/stoelzel.qmd)

To ensure high and consistent quality, we follow a set of [editorial guidelines](editorial-guidelines.qmd) when preparing our editions. Moreover, we have implemented a largely automated engraving and publishing process. Briefly, this workflow encompasses

- beautiful scores engraved by [LilyPond](https://lilypond.org),
- prefatory material typeset with [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), and
- compilation of editions via [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container to ensure reproducibility.

Details on the workflow are available in the comprehensive [technical documentation](technical-documentation.qmd).
