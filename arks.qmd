## Overview

A semi-opaque Archival Resource Key ([ARK](https://arks.org)) is assigned to each edition as persistent identifier:

- Each ARK uses the Name Assigning Authority Number ([NAAN](https://arks.org/about/ark-naans-and-systems/)) `68748` …
- … and the [Shoulder](https://arks.org/about/ark-features/) `e1`.
- The [Blade](https://arks.org/specs/) consists of a composer acronym and work identifier.

  |Composer|Acronym|Work ID|
  |-|-|-|
  |Eybler|jle|HerEy number|
  |Haydn|jmh|MH number|
  |Tůma|fit|TumW number|
  |Werner|gjw|WerW number|
  |Zelenka|jdz|ZWV number|

- The Base Name resolves to the full score; parts are denoted by Part Qualifiers, i.e., a slash followed by the part abbreviation.

ARKs are resolved by `https://ark.esser-skala.at` via a [minimal ARK resolver](https://github.com/edition-esser-skala/minimal-ark-resolver). (They are also forwarded to the resolver from this site's base URL via its `.htaccess` file.)
