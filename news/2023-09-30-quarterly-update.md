### Fuchs, Johann Nepomuk

  Johann Nepomuk Fuchs studied with Joseph Haydn. From 1784 he worked in Prince Esterházy's chapel and took over its direction after Haydn's death. He retained this post under Prince Nicholas III. and Paul III. Anton for about 40 years. If you believe the few biographical notes available, he was one of the most important church composers of his time. Nevertheless, his works have been almost completely forgotten. Our editions (more are in preparation) will hopefully revive interest in this great composer.


### Galuppi, Baldassare

- [Kyrie](/scores/baldassare-galuppi/#work-burg-i-20) BurG I/20
- [Regina cœli](/scores/baldassare-galuppi/#work-burg-ii-68) BurG II/68


### Haydn, Johann Michael

- [Vesperæ pro festo Sanctissimæ Innocentium](/scores/johann-michael-haydn/#work-mh-548) MH 548<br/>
  A vesper for female choir (SSA).
- [Vesperæ de Dominica](/scores/johann-michael-haydn/#work-mh-809star) MH 809<br/>
   The autograph manuscript of this work ([H-Bn Ms.mus II.48](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=530001730), dated 1802-01-27) is a setting of the psalm *Dixit Dominus* in four movements. By contrast, this version contains five vesper movements. Most likely, the original psalm setting was arranged to a vesper by Johann Wittmann of the Lambach abbey (copy [A-LA 1397](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=603002682), dated 1802–1823). This is corroborated by the title page of a copy in the Kremsmünster abbey ([A-KR E 14/61](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=600176395), dated 1823; title page: “[…] Ex Michaelis Haydn unico Psalmo: | Dixit Dominus traductae, et transformatae | per D. Joannem Wittmann, Musicum Lamba- | censem”). The copy in the Domarchiv Salzburg ([A-Sd A 561](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=659000641), dated 1831) contains an additional setting of *Laudate Dominum* by Luigi Gatti.
- [Applicatio](/scores/johann-michael-haydn/#work-mh-279) MH 279<br/>
  One of two sacred compositions in honor of St. Rupert of Salzburg, which have been preserved in the British Library ([GB-Lbm Add. 32.173](https://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/FullDisplay.aspx?ref=Add_MS_32173)).
- [Attale et Erimene](/scores/johann-michael-haydn/#work-mh-11) MH 11<br/>
  The fragment of an early profane cantata.
- The [Proprium Missæ](/projects/haydn-m-proprium-missae/) project now also includes MH 253, 269, 379, and 400. Moreover, MH 29 has been updated (realized org).
