## New editions

### Albrechtsberger, Johann Georg

- [Missa in D major](/scores/johann-georg-albrechtsberger/#work-a-wn-hk-5-i) (A-Wn HK.5/I)<br/>
  This mass bases upon the autograph manuscript and includes a gradual and offertory.

### Caldara, Antonio

We continue our *Caldara@Dresden* project with editions of the remaining masses extant in Dresden:

- [Missa Intende in adiutorium meum](/scores/antonio-caldara/#work-d-dl-mus-2170-d-10) (D-Dl Mus.2170-D-10)
- [Missa Matris dolorosæ](/scores/antonio-caldara/#work-d-dl-mus-2170-d-4) (D-Dl Mus.2170-D-4)
- [Missa Mundata est lepra eius](/scores/antonio-caldara/#work-d-dl-mus-2170-d-12) (D-Dl Mus.2170-D-12)
- [Missa Vix orimur morimur](/scores/antonio-caldara/#work-d-dl-mus-2170-d-13) (D-Dl Mus.2170-D-13)


### Danzi, Franz Ignaz

 - [Mass in D major](/scores/franz-ignaz-danzi/#work-pecd-58) PecD 58


### Haydn, Johann Michael

- [Litaniæ de Venerabili Sacramento](/scores/johann-michael-haydn/#work-mh-228) MH 228<br/>
  We managed to find a digital version of the autograph manuscript and thus updated our edition. A comparison to the 1823 print revealed that the latter edition contained several errors and mistakes and was highly inaccurate regarding bass figures, slurs, and dynamics.
- [Vesperæ de Dominica](/scores/johann-michael-haydn/#work-mh-321) MH 321
- The [Proprium Missæ](/projects/haydn-m-proprium-missae/) project now also includes MH 491 and 503.


### Hofmann, Leopold

- [Missa festiva](/scores/leopold-hofmann/#work-a-ed-a-99) ProH deest<br/>
  A cute Missa brevis which we consider a genuine composition by Hofmann, even if it is absent from Hermine Prohászka's  [catalogue of works](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41465272).


### Scheibe, Johann Adolph

- [Der wundervolle Tod des Welterlösers](/scores/johann-adolph-scheibe/#work-schw-online-b2-313) SchW online B2:213<br/>
  What a pity that the second part of this passion has been lost!


### Tůma, František Ignác Antonín

- [Vesperæ de Confessore](/scores/frantisek-ignac-antonin-tuma/#work-d-dl-mus-2968-d-508) (D-Dl Mus.2968-D-508)



## Performances

In two concerts entitled *Austrian Encounters* (21 and 22 May 2022), the [Australian Boys Choir](https://www.australianboyschoir.com.au/), The Vocal Consort and Australian Romantic & Classical Orchestra, conducted by [Nicholas Dinopoulos](https://www.nickdinopoulos.com), have performed Michael Haydn's [Litaniæ lauretanæ](/scores/johann-michael-haydn/#work-mh-71) MH 71. We had the honor of contributing to a [blog post](https://www.australianboyschoir.com.au/blog/michael-haydn/) introducing Haydn's work.
